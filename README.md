# ConsoleMatrixPython
a simple program that prints green 0s and 1s to the console

This is a python script that randomly either prints out a 0 or a 1 to the console. Colors are being made possible with ANSI color codes.

USAGE:
- clone the repository
- change into the newly cloned directory
- run the matrix.py file with python3 because of the f string inside the script (only available in python3)
- -> python3 matrix.py
- then you will be prompted for a delay in milliseconds, the amount of 0s and 1s you want depending on your terminal size and the color
